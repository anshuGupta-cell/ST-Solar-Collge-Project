[1/14, 20:47] S T: 1. *Renewable & Sustainable Energy*
Solar PV uses sunlight, an unlimited and renewable energy source, helping reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
2. *Eco-Friendly*
It produces electricity without air pollution, greenhouse gases, or noise, supporting a cleaner environment.
3. *Low Electricity Bills*
Solar panels significantly reduce monthly electricity costs and can even generate surplus power.
4. *Low Maintenance*
Solar PV systems require minimal maintenance and have a long operational life (25–30 years).
5. *Energy Independence*
Users become less dependent on the power grid and rising electricity prices.
6. *Easy Installation*
Solar PV systems are easy to install on rooftops, open land, or commercial buildings.
7. *Scalable & Flexible*
Systems can be expanded easily according to future energy needs.
8. *Suitable for Remote Areas*
Provides electricity in rural and off-grid locations where conventional power is unavailable.
9.*Government Support & Subsidies*
Many governments offer subsidies, tax benefits, and incentives for solar installations.
10. *Increases Property Value*
Buildings with solar PV systems have higher market value and better energy ratings.
[1/14, 20:49] S T: 1. *High Initial Cost*
The upfront cost of solar panels, inverters, and installation is relatively high.
2. *Weather Dependent*
Solar power generation depends on sunlight and is less effective on cloudy or rainy days.
3. *No Power at Night*
Solar PV systems do not generate electricity at night without battery storage.
4. *Requires Large Space*
Large systems need sufficient roof or land area for proper installation.
5. *Energy Storage is Expensive*
Batteries increase the overall system cost and require periodic replacement.
6. *Lower Efficiency*
Solar panels have limited efficiency compared to conventional power sources.
7. *Installation Location Matters*
Shadows from trees or buildings can reduce power output significantly.
8. *Inverter Replacement Cost*
Inverters have a shorter lifespan than panels and may need replacement after 8–12 years.
[1/14, 21:16] S T: 1. *Residential Power Supply*
Used in homes for lighting, fans, TVs, refrigerators, and other household appliances.
2. *Commercial Buildings*
Installed in offices, malls, hotels, and hospitals to reduce electricity costs.
3. *Industrial Power Generation*
Provides power for factories, warehouses, and small manufacturing units.
4. *Rural & Off-Grid Electrification*
Supplies electricity to remote villages where grid power is unavailable.
5. *Solar Street Lighting*
Used for street lights, highways, parking areas, and public spaces.
6. *Water Pumping Systems*
Solar PV runs irrigation pumps and drinking water supply systems in agriculture.
7. *Telecommunication Systems*
Used in mobile towers, relay stations, and remote communication networks.
8. *Educational Institutions*
Provides clean energy to schools, colleges, and research centers.
9. *Healthcare Facilities*
Used in hospitals and clinics for reliable power to medical equipment.
10. *Portable & Small Devices*
Used in solar chargers, calculators, lamps, and portable power systems.
[1/14, 21:45] S T: *Working Steps:*
1.*Sunlight Absorption*
Solar panels absorb sunlight falling on their surface.
2.*Generation of Electron–Hole Pairs*
The absorbed light energy excites electrons in the semiconductor material (usually silicon).
3.*Charge Separation*
The built-in electric field at the p–n junction separates electrons and holes.
4.*Flow of Electric Current*
Electrons move through the external circuit, producing DC electricity.
5.*Power Conversion*
The DC power is converted into AC power using an inverter for practical use.
6.*Utilization / Storage*
The generated electricity is used directly, stored in batteries, or supplied to the grid.
